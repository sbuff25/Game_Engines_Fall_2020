# My Game for Week 3
* my game is a simple game centered around avoiding two patrolling enemies.
* The Script that I used from the Unity playground was the patrol script on the saws.
* I tried implementing the ui script and prefab but couldn't get it to work correctly.
* I do apologize for the lack of content this week but I had to spend a good deal of time this week getting the zombie thoughts project for MT Rep working correctly, this ended up taking up a very large chunk of time and unfortunately resulted in me neglecting some of my school stuff.
